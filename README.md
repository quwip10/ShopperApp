# Shopper App
Ongoing Python3 learnings

# Introduction
This project started as a school assignment to build a simple,
shopping cart CLI with classes.

I am continuing to modify the project with guidance to make it
more industry standard.

# Use
Right now the project can be run in interactive mode simply by
running python3 main.py after cloning/downloading.

Future modifications will allow all interaction via CLI arguments
and perhaps a database to allow persistance between sessions.
